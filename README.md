# mancalabot
Just a dump for all my mancala code, not a serious project just practicing coding

You input the board of any mancala game and this code will return the best move for you to make.

Basically I got really tired of losing mancala and made python do it for me.
...no one plays mancala with me anymore lol

I want to get into coding in college so now seems like a good time to learn all this github and stuff
oldspaghetticode is old versions of this I made a while ago and are TERRIBLY organized, dont even bother with them
